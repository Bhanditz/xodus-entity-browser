How to run:

    * fill database credentials into xodus-store.properties file
    * execute script run.bat or run.sh
    * open browser http://localhost:8080 (Jetty server binds to all interfaces on port 8080 therefore all interfaces can be
        used to access application)


Hot to configure
    * to modify JVM arguments, server port or properties file location feel free to modify startup scripts.
